# Get data from the server

Run the script.py file. Note that the prerequisite is to install the driver for the corresponding browser. The example here uses the Chorme browser, so you need to download the [Google Chorme driver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

After installing the chorme driver, run the code, and the program will automatically crawl the server data every 30 seconds and save it as a csv file locally.

The displayed data will be updated as the csv file is updated. The update interval can be changed according to the server data update frequency to achieve the effect of real-time display of server data.
